First, a `Query` enters ``Chat history``. Then the ``Chat history`` is processed through the ``LLM`` to get the Intent. The docs or chunks with high similarity to the intention is retrieved through the knowledge base. Use the search results to update the ``System prompt``. Finally, send the *``System prompt`` and ``Chat history`` to the ``LLM`` and get the relevant response, which will be part of the ``Chat history``. In general, the process repeats itself.
